# bowling

My family is a family of bowlers. One of them wanted software to track their bowling scores. In addition to suggesting they try Excel, which is marvelous for that sort of thing, I built what they had asked for in Clojure.

## Usage

Assuming you have both lein and git installed you can see the app with:


    git clone https://github.com/jColeChanged/bowling.git
    cd bowling
    lein deps
    lein compile
    lein run
