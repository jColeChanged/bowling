# bowling

My family is a family of bowlers. One of them wanted software to track their bowling scores. In addition to suggesting they try Excel, which is marvelous for that sort of thing, I built what they had asked for in Clojure.

## Usage

git clone url
cd bowling
lein deps
lein compile
java thejar
